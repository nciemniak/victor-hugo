  about: >-
    **Annie Zean Dunbar is an educator and social worker, and has worked in
    multicultural communities as a program manager, survey researcher, and case
    manager.**


    Her research interests include race and identity formation, trauma and
    reconciliation, secondary migration, and long term refugee and migrant
    resettlement in the United States.  Zeanâ€™s creative writing centers
    community conceptions of truth and omission, the liminal space between
    understanding self and others, and an examination of memory. She is a
    cofounder of Connect-the- Dots, an arts based organization focused on
    examining social constructs and human connection. 


    Zean is a graduate from the Social Service Administration at the University
    of Chicago with a program of study in International Social Welfare. Annie
    Zean is a 2014 Fellow of the Pozen Family Center for Human Rights at the
    University of Chicago, and holds certificate in Forced Migration from Center
    for Refugee Studies at York University and Refugee Protection and the Rights
    and Process of (Re)Settlement through the Center for Forced Migration
    Studies. As a Human Rights Fellow for the Pozen Family Center for Human
    Rights, Annie Zean was deployed to Monrovia, Liberia during the summer of
    2014.  Her fellowship was designed to educate women in Monrovia on the
    upcoming election and improve voter registration and participation.  Because
    of the Ebola outbreak, she was reassigned to the Social Mobilization team to
    survey community members on their understanding of the Ebola risks and
    provide outreach and education to community members to improve compliance
    with public health directives. 


    She is the Social Media Lead for the Emerging Scholars and Practitioner on
    Migration Issues (ESPMI) Network. Zean would describe herself as a post-goth
    black woman, perpetual optimist, with an affinity for commas, sing alongs,
    and referential humor.
