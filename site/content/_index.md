    Her research interests include racial identity formation, trauma and
    reconciliation, mutual aid and community care, and long term refugee and
    migrant resettlement organizations in the United States.  Zeanâ€™s creative
    writing centers community conceptions of truth and omission, the liminal
    space between understanding self and others, and an examination of memory.
    She is a cofounder of Interstitial Media Arts (IMA) a creative consulting
    firm and Connect-the- Dots, an arts based organization focused on examining
    social constructs and human connection. 


    Zean is a graduate from the Crown Family School of Social Work, Policy and
    Practice at the University of Chicago with a program of study in
    International Social Welfare. Annie Zean is a 2014 Fellow of the Pozen
    Family Center for Human Rights at the University of Chicago, and holds
    certificate in Forced Migration from Center for Refugee Studies at York

    (Re)Settlement through the Center for Forced Migration Studies. 


    She is the Social Media Lead for the Emerging Scholars and Practitioner on
    Migration Issues (ESPMI) Network. Zean would describe herself as a post-goth
    black woman, perpetual optimist, with an affinity for commas, sing alongs,
    and referential humor.
